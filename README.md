# PowerBI-Project
Dashboards are important to understand the business better by looking at sales, profits, prices, and regions. I gathered the data from Excel using a tool called Power Query. Once I had the data, I created a dashboard. Think of it like a control center where we organize everything neatly with titles and shapes.

Now, for the exciting part â€“ the visuals that help us make sense of all the data:

1. **Q&A with AI:**
   - We use fancy AI to let you ask questions in regular words. It's like having a chat with the data to quickly get the info you need.

2. **Key Influencers:**
   - We figure out what makes our brands profitable. This helps us see what's really driving our success.

3. **Map Chart for Regions:**
   - Imagine a map that shows where our sales are happening. It helps us see which areas are doing well and where we might need to focus more.

4. **Matrix for Money Stuff:**
   - We create a table that's good at showing details like how much we charge for each unit and how much profit we're making. It's like a detailed money report.

5. **Timeline You Can Play With:**
   - We make a timeline that you can easily change. Want to see how things were last month or last year? Just click around and see the info you want.

All these visuals together help us understand our business better, and the best part is, they're easy to use. So, whether you're into numbers or just want a quick overview, our dashboard has you covered!
